                    <p>You have probably used computers to do all sorts of useful and interesting things. In each
                        application, the computer responds in different ways to your input, from the keyboard, mouse or
                        a file. Still the underlying operations are determined by the design of the program you are
                        given. In this set of tutorials you will learn to write your own computer programs, so you can
                        give the computer instructions to react in the way you want.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>First let us place Python programming in the context of the computer hardware. At the most
                        fundamental level in thecomputer there are instructions built into the hardware. These are very
                        simple instructions, peculiar to the hardwareof your particular type of computer. The
                        instructions are designed to be simple for the hardware to execute, not forhumans to follow. The
                        earliest programming was done with such instructions. If was difficult and error-prone. A major
                        advance was the development of higher-level languages and translators for them. Higher-level
                        languages allowcomputer programmers to write instructions in a format that is easier for humans
                        to understand. For example</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">z = x+y</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>is an instruction in many high-level languages that means something like:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Access the value stored at a location labeled x.</li>
                        <li>Calculate the sum of this value and the value stored at a location labeled y.</li>
                        <li>Store the result in a location labeled z.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>No computer understands the high-level instruction directly; it is not inmachine language. A
                        special program mustfirst translate instructions like this one into machine language. This one
                        high-level instruction might be translated intoa sequence of three machine language instructions
                        corresponding to the three step description above:</p>
                    <code>
              0000010010000001
              0000000010000010
              0000010110000011
            </code>
                    <p>Obviously high-level languages were a great advance in clarity!</p>
                    <p>If you follow a broad introduction to computing, you will learn more about the layers that
                        connect low-level digitalcomputer circuits to high-level languages.</p>

                    <p>There are many high-level languages. The language you will be learning is Python. Python is one
                        of the easiestlanguages to learn and use, while at the same time being very powerful: It is one
                        of the most used languages byhighly productive professional programmers. Also Python is a free
                        language! If you have your own computer, youcan download it from the Internet...

                        Even if you have Python on your own computer, you may well not have the latest version.</p>
                    <p>If you think you already have a current Python set to go, then try starting Idle:<a

                        the version stated near the top of its window matches the latest version of Python, then fine!
                    </p>
                    <p>Otherwise, if you are using Windows or a Mac, see the Appendices (page 187) for instructions for
                        individual operatingsystems.

                        <b>Linux </b> An older version of Python is generally installed, and even if a current version,
                        3.1+, is installed, Idle is install, something like ‘idle-python’ (the name in the Ubuntu
                        distribution).

                    <p>Although Python is a high-level language, it is <i>not</i> English or some other natural human
                        language. The Pythontranslator does not understand “add the numbers two and three”. Python is a
                        formal language with its own specificrules and formats, which these tutorials will introduce
                        gradually, at a pace intended for a beginner. These tutorials arealso appropriate for beginners
                        because they gradually introduce fundamental logical programming skills. Learning these skills
                        will allow you to much more easily program in other languages besides Python. Some of the skills
                        you will learn are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>breaking down problems into manageable parts</li>
                        <li>building up creative solutions</li>
                        <li>making sure the solutions are clear for humans</li>
                        <li>making sure the solutions also work correctly on the computer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Guiding Principals for the Hands-on Python Tutorials:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The best way to learn is by active participation. Information is principally introduced in
                            small quantities, whereyour active participation, experiencing Python, is assumed. In many
                            place you will only be able to see whatPython does by doing it yourself (in a hands-on
                            fashion). The tutorial will often not show. Among the mostcommon and important words in the
                            tutorial are “Try this:”</li>
                        <li>Other requests are for more creative responses. Sometimes there are Hints, which end up as
                            hyperlinks in theweb page version, and footnote references in the pdf version. Both formats
                            should encourage you to thinkactively about your response first before looking up the hint.
                            The tutorials also provide labeled exercises, forfurther practice, without immediate answers
                            provided. The exercises are labeled at three levels</li>
                        <p><b>No label</b> Immediate reinforcement of basic ideas - <i>preferably do on your first
                                pass</i>.</p>
                        <p>* Important and more substantial - be sure you can end up doing these. Allow time to do them!
                        </p>
                        <p>** Most creative</p>
                        <li>Information is introduced in an order that gives you what you need as soon as possible. The
                            information ispresented in context. Complexity and intricacy that is not immediately needed
                            is delayed until later, when you are more experienced.</li>
                        <li>In many places there <i>are</i> complications thatareimportant in the beginning, because
                            there is acommonerrorcaused by a slight misuse of the current topic. If such a <i>common</i>
                            error is likely to make no sense and slow youdown, more information is given to allow you to
                            head off or easily react to such an error.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although this approach is an effective way to introduce material, it is not so good for
                        reference. Referencing isaddressed in several ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Detailed Table of Contents</li>
                        <li> Extensive Index in the web page version</li>
                        <li> Flexible Search Engine built into the html version (does <i>not</i> work on an html version
                            that you download to your computer)</li>
                        <li>Cross references to sections that elaborate on an introductory section. Hyperlinks allow you
                            to jump betweenthe referenced parts in the html version or the pdf version viewed on a
                            computer. The pdf version also givespage references.</li>
                        <li>Concise chapter summaries, grouping logically related items, even if that does not match the
                            order of introduc-tion.</li>
                    </ul>

                <article>
                    <p>The Hands-on Python Tutorial was originally a document to read, with both the html version and a
                        pdf version. Evenif you do not print it, some people use the pdf version online, preferring its
                        formatting to the formatting in the htmlversion.</p>
                    <p>Some people learn better visually and verbally from the very beginning. The Tutorial has videos
                        for many sections.</p>
                    <p> Also mentioned for the convenience of my Comp 150 class are videos beyond Python, for the part
                        of the class afterPython.</p>
                    <p>The videos are copied into two places:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://loyolauniversitychicago-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aharrin_luc_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Faharrin%5Fluc%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FComp150&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb3lvbGF1bml2ZXJzaXR5Y2hpY2Fnby1teS5zaGFyZXBvaW50LmNvbS86ZjovZy9wZXJzb25hbC9haGFycmluX2x1Y19lZHUvRXNGXzBFR3dubUZBcHdobW5Iak5WQWtCS3hyZlpjeVFOMXBGdC1BSzJ5cU1iUT9ydGltZT0yTWpfcW5SOTJFZw"
                                target="_blank">OneDrive</a> . There are five zip files of videos that you can download
                            and unzip, plus individualmp4’s for the Python Tutorial appendix sections. There is one zip
                            file for each chapter 1-4 of the PythonTutorial and one zip file (BeyondPython.zip) for the
                            remainder of my Comp class after the Python.</li>
                        <p>Downloads of the parts do not need any ID. Unzip (expand) any zip file before using.</p>
                        <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5WvvnDHeaIYMGE2MzU4OWEtYzQ4Zi00YzhiLTliMTItNjRjYzMyYzgyMTk2?usp=sharing"
                                target="_blank">Google Drive</a>: You need a Google Drive/Docs login ID. If you are not
                            already logged into Google Drive/Docs, you will needto do it when you click on the link. If
                            you have that ID, then the advantage of Google Drive is that you canselect exactly what
                            parts to view or download. This may not work with Internet Explorer, but it does work
                            withFirefox, Safari or Chrome browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To get the most out of the tutorial, I strongly suggest the following approach for each part:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watch a video if you like. They are clearly labeled by numerical section. Stop the video
                            where I ask you to <i>think</i>. The videos hit the high points and take advantage of being
                            able to point at specific places on the screen.They are not as recent as the current text,
                            so they may look a bit different than the tutorial in a web page.</li>
                        <p>Some details may only appear in the written text.</p>
                        <p>Stop the video frequently to test things for yourself! If a new function is introduced, do
                            not only watch the video,but try it out for yourself, including with data not in the video.
                            In some places the written version mentions moreexamples to try.</p>
                        <li>Whether you look at the video of a section or not, do look through a written version, either
                            as a first pass or toreview and fill in holes from the videos. Be sure to stop and try
                            things yourself, and see how they actually workon your computer.</li>
                        <li> Look at the labeled exercises. You are strongly recommended to give the unstarred ones an
                            immediate try toreinforce basic concepts. The starred ones (*) are important for a strong
                            understanding. Do not get too far aheadin reading/watching before trying the starred
                            exercises. Understanding earlier parts well enough to be able tosolve problems is going to
                            either be completely necessary for understanding some later sections or at least makelater
                            sections easier to follow and fully comprehend.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>While the tutorial introduces all the topics, there is more to say about using it effectively.
                        There is way too much detailto just absorb all at once, So what are the first things to learn?
                    </p>
                    <p>More important than memorizing details is having an idea of the building blocks available and how
                        they are useful.For the most direct exercises, you might just look back over the most recent
                        section looking for related things, but thatwill not work when you have scores of sections that
                        might have useful parts! The basic idea of the building blocksshould be in your head. For
                        instance, looking ahead to when you have finished the Tutorial through 1.10.4, you willwant to
                        have these ideas very present in your head to be ready to start on the exercises:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can use numbers and do arithmetic.</li>
                        <li>You can store and retrieve data using variable names and assignment statements.</li>
                        <li>Python has many useful built-in functions that can affect the system or return results for
                            you to use.</li>
                        <li>You can get keyboard input from the user and print things back for the user.</li>
                        <li>Data comes in different types, and you can convert where it makes sense.</li>
                        <li>You can use strings and generate them in many ways: literal strings, concatenation operator
                            (+), string formatmethod.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once you have an idea of the appropriate building blocks needed to solve a specific problem, then
                        you can worryabout more details. Particularly at the beginning, you are not likely to have all
                        the exact Python syntax for the partsof your solution nailed down! It is not important to
                        remember it precisely, but it is important to know how to find aclear explanation efficiently:
                        Know the location in examples or in the tutorial, or use the index, the search
                        capacity,summaries, and/or write things in notes for yourself - as for an exam. Writing short
                        bits down is also useful because the <i>act of writing</i> helps many people absorb what they
                        are writing.</p>
                    <p>As your experience increases you will get used to and remember more and more stuff, but there is
                        always the latestidea/syntax to get used to! Your notes of what is important, but still not in
                        immediate recall, will evolve continuously.</p>
                    <p>This multi-tiered approach means that what you absorb should not just be an enormous collection
                        of unstructuredfacts that you plumb through in its entirety to find a useful idea. You first
                        need to be particularly aware of the majorheadings of useful features, and then do what you need
                        to drill down to details as necessary.</p>
                    <p>This approach is important in the real-world, away from Python. The world is awash with way to
                        much informationto memorize, but you must access the information that you need to synthesize and
                        formulate solutions/arguments ...effectively!</p>
                    <p>Knowing all the building blocks of a solution is obviously important. Many successful holistic
                        thinkers can do thiseffectively. In some domains a knowledge of the pieces and their
                        relationships is enough. Programming requiresmore than this, however: It is critical to sort out
                        the exact <i>sequence</i> in which the pieces must logically appear. Some excellent holistic
                        thinkers have a hard time with this sequencing, and must pay extra attention when planning code.
                        Ifyou are like this, be patient and be prepared to ask for help where needed.</p>
                    <p>What to do <i>after</i> you finish an exercise is important, too. The natural thing
                        psychologically, particularly if you had astruggle, is to think, “Whew, outta here!!!!”</p>
                    <p>On something that came automatically or flowed smoothly, that is not a big deal - you will
                        probably get it just as fastthe next time. If you had a hard time and only eventually got to
                        success, you may be doing yourself a disservice with“Whew, outta here!!!”</p>
                    <p>We have already mentioned how not everything is equally important, and some things are more
                        important to keep in your head than others. The same idea applies to all the steps in solving a
                        possibly long problem. Some parts wereeasy; some were hard; there may have been several steps.
                        If all of that goes into your brain in one continuous streamof stuff that you remember at the
                        same level, then you are going to leave important nuggets mixed in with an awful lotof
                        unimportant and basically useless information. Then the information is likely to all fade into
                        oblivion, or be next to impossible to cycle through looking for the useful nuggets. Why do the
                        problem anyway if you are just going to buryimportant information further down in your brain?
                    </p>
                    <p>What is important? The most obvious thing you will need at a higher level of recall is what
                        <i>just messed you up</i>, whatyou missed until doing this problem: After finishing the actual
                        problem, <i>actively</i> follow up and ask yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What did I get in the end that I was missing initially? What was the connection I made?</li>
                        <li>Does this example fit in to some larger idea/abstraction/generalization in a way that I did
                            not see before?</li>
                        <li>How am I going to look at this so I can make a similar connection in a similar (or maybe
                            only partly similar)problem?</li>
                        <li>Is there a kernel here that I can think of as a new tool in my bag of tricks?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your answers to these questions are the most important things to take away from your recent hard
                        work. The extraconsideration puts them more in the “priority” part of your brain, so you can
                        really learn from your effort. When youneed the important ideas next, you do not need to play
                        through all the details of the stuff you did to solve the earlierproblem.</p>
                    <p>Keep coming back to this section and check up on your process: It is really important.</p>

                    <p>First you need to set up a location to store your work and the example programs from this
                        tutorial. You can put thefolder for your Python programs most anywhere you like. However, for
                        Chapter 4, it will be important that <i>none ofthe directories leading down to your Python
                            folder contain any blanks in them</i>, in particular your home folder.</p>
                    <p>The normal place for you to have my examples folder is under your home folder, which has the same
                        name as yourLogin ID. If you are just creating a login ID, it will save some hassle in Chapter
                        4, if your login ID doesnot have aspace in it. “Andy” or “anh” or AndyHarrington” would be fine
                        for me, but <b>“Andy Harrington”</b> would bomb the server in Chapter 4. It is possible to do
                        Chapter 4 with a folder outside your home folder, as discussedat the beginning of Chapter 4.</p>

            liked to eat {food}, but the jungle had                  9
            very little {food} to offer.  One day, an               10

            it liked {food}.  The explorer took the                 12

                    <p>The program that translates Python instructions and then executes them is the <i>Python
                            interpreter</i>.</p>
                    <p>This interpreter is embedded in a number of larger programs that make it particularly easy to
                        develop Python programs.Such a programming environment is <i>Idle</i>, and it is a part of the
                        standard distribution of Python.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to open the Idle app directly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start a search:</li>
                        <p>Windows: Press the Windows key or go to the start menu.</p>
                        <p>Mac: open Spotlight (Command-spacebar).</p>
                        <li>Enter Idle in the search field. Select the Idle app.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have Linux:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">The approach depends on the installation. In Ubuntu, you should
                            find Idle in the Programming section ofthe Applications menu. You are better starting idle
                            from a terminal, with the current directory being yourPython folder. You may need a special
                            name set up to distinguish idle for versions 2 and 3, for instanceidle3 for version 3.X.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will discuss later that if you want to edit files, this isnotthe best way to start Idle, since
                        the associated folder is <i>not</i> the one you want, but it works for now.</p>

                        Window. You are likely to first see an Editwindow, whose top left corner looks something like in

                        be using the Python Shell.</p>
                    <p>Either initially, or after explicitly opening it, you should now see the Python Shell window,

                    <p>n the Shell the last line should look like</p>
                    <code>
            &gt&gt&gt
          </code>
                    <p>The &gt&gt&gt is the <i>prompt</i>, telling you Idle is waiting for<i>you</i> to type something.
                        Continuing on the same line enter</p>
                    <code>
            6+3
          </code>
                    <p>Be sure to end with the Enter key. After the Shell responds, you should see something like</p>
                    <code>
            &gt&gt&gt 6+3
            9
            &gt&gt&gt
          </code>
                    <p>The shell evaluates the line you entered, and prints the result. You see Python does arithmetic.
                        At the end you see afurther prompt <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong> where you can enter your next
                        line.... The result line, showing <strong>9</strong>, that is produced by the computer,does not
                        start with <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong>.</p>

                <header>Whirlwind Introduction To Types and Functions</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Python directly recognizes a variety of types of data. Here are a few:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>Numbers: 3,6,-7,1.25</strong></li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>’hello’,’The answer is: ’</strong></li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>[1, 2, 3, 4], [’yes’, ’no’, ’maybe’]</strong></li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;"><strong>None</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Python has large collection of built-in functions that operate on different kinds of data to
                        produce all kinds of results.To make a function do its action, parentheses are required. These
                        parentheses surround the parameter or parameters,as in a function in algebra class.</p>
                    <p>The general syntax to execute a function is</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: none;"><i>functionName (parameters)</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One function is called <strong>type</strong>, and it returns the type of any object. The Python
                        Shell will evaluate functions. In theShell the last line should look like</p>
                    <code>
                   &gt&gt&gt
                 </code>
                    <p>Continuing on the same line enter</p>
                    <code>
                   type(7)
                 </code>
                    <p>Always remember to end with the <strong>Return</strong>(or Enter) key. After the Shell responds,
                        you should see something like</p>
                    <code>
                   &gt&gt&gt type(7)
                   &ltclass 'int'&gt
                   &gt&gt&gt</code>
                    <p>In the result,<strong>int</strong> is the way Python abbreviates integer. The word <i>class</i>
                        is basically a synonym for type in Python.</p>
                    <p>Note that the line with the value <i>produced</i> by the shell does not start with
                        <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong> and appears at the left margin. Henceyou can distinguish what the
                        computer responds from what you type (after the <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong> prompt).</p>
                    <p>At the end you see a further prompt where you can enter your next line....</p>
                    <p><i>For the rest of this section</i>, at the <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong>prompt in the Python
                        <i>Shell</i>, individually enter each line below that is set off in
                        <strong>typewriterfont</strong>. So next enter</p>
                    <code>
                   type(1.25)
                 </code>
                    <p>Note the name in the last result isfloat, not real or decimal, coming from the term “floating
                        point”, for reasons thatwill be explained later, in <i>Floats, Division, Mixed Types</i>(page
                        62).</p>
                    <p>Enter</p>
                    <code>
                   type('hello')
                 </code>
                    <p>In your last result you see another abbreviation: <strong>str</strong> rather than string. Enter
                    </p>
                    <code>
                   type([1, 2, 3])
                 </code>
                    <p>Strings and lists are both sequences of parts (characters or elements). We can find the
                        <b>length</b> of that sequence withanother function with the abbreviated name
                        <strong>len</strong>. Try both of the following, separately, in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>
                    <code>
                   len([2, 4, 6])
                   len('abcd')
                 </code>
                    <p>Some functions have no parameters, so nothing goes between the parentheses. For example, some
                        types serve asno-parameter functions to create a simple value of their type. Try</p>
                    <code>
                   list()
                 </code>
                    <p>You see the way an empty list is displayed.</p>
                    <p>Functions may also take more than one parameter. Try</p>
                    <code>
                   max(5, 11, 2)
                 </code>
                    <p>Above, max is short for maximum.</p>
                    <p>Some of the names of types serve as conversion functions (where there is an obvious meaning for
                        the conversion). Tryeach of the following, one at a time, in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>
                    <code>
                   str(23)
                   int('125')
                 </code>
                    <p>Note the presence and absence of quotes.</p>
                    <p>An <i>often handy Shell feature</i>: an earlier Shell line may to copied and edited by clicking
                        anywhere in the previouslydisplayed line and then pressing the <strong>Return</strong>(or Enter)
                        key. For instance you should have entered several lines startingwith <strong>len</strong>. Click
                        on any one, press <strong>Return</strong>, and edit the line for a different test.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>We start with the integers and integer arithmetic, not because arithmetic is exciting, but
                        because the symbolism shouldbe mostly familiar. Of course arithmetic is important in many cases,
                        but Python is probably more often used tomanipulate text and other sorts of data, as in the
                        sample program in <a class="nav-link" href="#Running_A_Sample_Program">Running A Sample
                            Program</a>(page 8).</p>
                    <p>Python understands numbers and standard arithmetic. <i>For the whole section on integer
                            arithmetic</i>, where you see a set-off line in <strong>typewriter</strong> font, type
                        individual lines at the <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong> prompt in the Python <i>Shell</i>. Press
                        Enter after eachline to get Python to respond:</p>
                    <code>
              77
              2 + 3
              5 - 7
            </code>
                    <p>Python should evaluate and print back the value of each expression. Of course the first one does
                        not require anycalculation. It appears that the shell just echoes back what you printed.</p>
                    <p>The Python Shell is an interactive interpreter. As you can see, after you press
                        <strong>Return</strong>(or Enter), it is evaluating theexpression you typed in, and then
                        printing the result automatically. This is a very handy environment to check outsimple Python
                        syntax and get instant feedback. For more elaborate programs that you want to save, we will
                        switch toan Editor Window later.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Try in theShell:</p>
                    <code>
             2 x 3
            </code>
                    <p>You should get your first <i>syntax error</i>. The <strong>x</strong> should have become
                        highlighted, indicating the location where the Python interpreter discovered that it cannot
                        understand you: Python does not use <strong>x</strong> for multiplication as you may have done
                        in grade school. The <strong>x</strong>can be confused with the use of<strong>x</strong>as a
                        variable (more on that later).</p>
                    <p>Instead the symbol for multiplication is an asterisk *. Enter each of the following. You may
                        include spaces or not. ThePython interpreter can figure out what you mean either way. (The space
                        can make understanding quicker for a humanreader.) Try in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>
                    <code>
              2*5
              2 + 3*4</code>
                    <p>If you expected the last answer to be 20, think again: Python uses the normal <i>precedence</i>
                        of arithmetic operations:Multiplications and divisions are done before addition and subtraction,
                        unless there are parentheses. Try</p>
                    <code>
              (2+3)*4
              2*(4 - 1)
            </code>
                    <p>Now try the following in the <i>Shell</i>, exactly as written, followed by
                        <strong>Enter</strong>, with <i>no</i> closing parenthesis:</p>
                    <code>
              5*(2 + 3
            </code>
                    <p>Look carefully. There is no answer given at the left margin of the next line and no prompt
                        <strong>&gt&gt&gt</strong> to start a <i>new</i> expression.If you are using Idle, the cursor
                        has gone to the next line and has only <i>indented</i> slightly. Python is waiting for you
                        tofinish your expression. It is smart enough to know that opening parentheses are always
                        followed by the same numberof closing parentheses. The cursor is on a <i>continuation</i> line.
                        Type just the matching close-parenthesis and Enter,</p>
                    <code>
              )
            </code>
                    <p>and you should finally see the expression evaluated. (In some versions of the Python interpreter,
                        the interpreter puts‘...’ at the beginning of a continuation line, rather than just indenting.)
                    </p>
                    <p>Negation also works. Try in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>

                    <p>If you think about it, you learned several ways to do division. Eventually you learned how to do
                        division resulting in a decimal. Try in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>
                    <code>
              5/2
              14/4
            </code>
                    <p>As you saw in the previous section, numbers with decimal points in them are of type float in
                        Python. They are discussed more in <i>Floats, Division, Mixed Types</i>(page 62)</p>
                    <p>In early grade school you would likely say “14 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 2”. The
                        problem here is thatthe answer is in two parts, the integer quotient 3 and the remainder 2, and
                        neither of these results is the same as thedecimal result. Python has <i>separate</i> operations
                        to generate each part. Python uses the doubled division symbol // for the operation that
                        produces just the integer quotient, and introduces the symbol % for the operation of finding
                        theremainder. Try each in the <i>Shell</i>:</p>
                    <code>
              14/4
              14//4
              14%4
            </code>
                    <p>Now predict and then try each of</p>
                    <code>
              23//5
              23%5
              20%5
              6//8
              6%8
              6/8

            <p>Enough with numbers for a while. Strings of characters are another important type in Python.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>A string in Python is a sequence of characters. For Python to recognize a sequence of characters,
                        likehello, as astring, it must be enclosed in quotes to delimit the string.</p>
                    <p><i>For this whole section on strings</i>, continue trying each set-off line of code in the
                        <i>Shell</i>. Try</p>
                    <code>
              "hello"
            </code>
                    <p>Note that the interpreter gives back the string with <i>single</i> quotes. Python does not care
                        what system you use. Try</p>
                    <code>
              'Hi!'
            </code>
                    <p>Having the choice of delimiters can be handy.</p>
                    <p>Figure out how to give Python the string containing the text: <strong>I’m happy.</strong> Try it.
                        If you got an error, try it withanother type of quotes, and figure out why that one works and
                        not the first.</p>
                    <p>There are many variations on delimiting strings and embedding special symbols. We will consider
                        more ways later in<i>Strings Part II</i>(page 21).</p>
                    <p class="note-desc"><b>Note</b>: A string can have any number of characters in it, including 0. The
                        empty string is ’’(two quote characterswith nothing between them). Many beginners forget that
                        having no characters in the middle is legal. It can be useful.</p>
                    <p>Strings are a new Python type. Try</p>
                    <code>
              type('dog')
              type('7')
              type(7)
            </code>
                    <p>The last two lines show how easily you can get confused! Strings can include any characters,
                        <i>including</i> digits. Quotesturn even digits into strings. This will have consequences in the

                    <p>Strings also have operation symbols. Try in the <i>Shell</i>(noting the <i>space</i> after
                        <strong>very</strong>):</p>
                    <code>
              'very ' + 'hot'
            </code>
                    <p>The plus operation with strings means <i>concatenate</i>the strings. Python looks at the type of
                        operands before decidingwhat operation is associated with the +.</p>
                    <p>Think of the relation of addition and multiplication of integers, and then guess the meaning of
                    </p>
                    <code>
              3*'very ' + 'hot'
            </code>
                    <p>Were you right? The ability to repeat yourself easily can be handy.</p>
                    <p>Predict the following and then test. Remember the last section on types:</p>
                    <code>
              7+2
              '7'+'2'
            </code>
                    <p>Python checks the types and interprets the plus symbol based on the type. Try</p>
                    <code>
              '7'+2
            </code>
                    <p>With mixed string and int types, Python sees an ambiguous expression, and does not guess which
                        you want - it justgives an error!</p>
                    <p>This is a traceback error. These occur when the code is being executed. In the last two lines of
                        the traceback it showsthe Python line where the error was found, and then a reason for the
                        error. Not all reasons are immediately intelligibleto a starting programmer, but they are
                        certainly worth checking out. In this case it is pretty direct. You need to makean explicit
                        conversion, so both are strings if you mean concatenation,’7’ + str(2), or so both are int if
                        you meanaddition,int(’7’) + 2.</p>
                    <p>With literal strings these examples are only useful for illustration: There is no reason to write
                        such verbose expressionswhen you already know the intended result. Withvariables, starting in
                        the next section, expressions involving theseconversions become more important....</p>
                    <h3>String Exercise</h3>
                    <p>Figure out a <i>compact</i> way to get Python to make the string,
                        ’<strong>YesYesYesYesYes</strong>’, and try it. How about
                        ’<strong>MaybeMaybeMaybeYesYesYesYesYes</strong>’? Hint:</p>
